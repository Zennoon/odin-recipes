            translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and tomato paste; stir until hot, <br>
            about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining butter, berbere, garlic, and ginger. Adjust heat <br>
            to low and cook until mixture thickens to paste consistency, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir remaining water into berbere paste; add chicken. Simmer until thickened to <br>
            sauce consistency, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir white wine, cardamom, and black pepper into the sauce; add hard-boiled <br>
            eggs. Cook until sauce is reduced slightly, about 15 minutes more.</li>
