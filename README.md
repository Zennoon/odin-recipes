# odin-recipes
This is the first of many projects to be done in the odin project curriculum.
This Project is named odin-recipes, and is focused on building a simple website that showcases some recipes.
This project is intended to strengthen and demonstrate my skills in using the different html elements, along with some of their attributes that I have learnt thus far, using the basic git commands efficiently and using external links.
